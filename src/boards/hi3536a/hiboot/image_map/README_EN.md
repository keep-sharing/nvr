## I. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
This directory provides a set of scripts for building images. The following types of images are supported:
- Non-Secure image
- Secure images
Before building, configuration file is needed. The template of the configuration file can be generated by the script.

### 1.2 Scope
Scripts in this directory are invoked by OEM and third party to build single-signed images and double sign the built images respectively.

|    User     |             Operation            |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| OEM         | build single-signed images       |
| Third party | double sign the built images     |

Dual signatures are optional based on demands.

### 1.3 Secure Boot Feature
- There are two security modes: Non-Secure and Secure.
- There are two types of start flows: Non-TEE and TEE. Their startup sequence is as follows:

|  Start Flow  |          Startup Sequence               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
|   Non-TEE    |  GSL -> U-Boot -> ATF -> Linux          |
|     TEE      |  GSL -> U-Boot -> ATF-> TEE-OS -> Linux |

- Images in different modes take the following characteristics:

| Security Mode  | Start Flow |         Target Image          | Sign? | Encrypt? | Support OP-TEE? |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|
|   Non-Secure   |  Non-TEE   | boot_image.bin                |  No   |    No    |      No         |
|   Secure       |  Non-TEE   | boot_image.bin                |  Yes  |    Yes   |      No         |
|   Secure       |  TEE       | boot_image.bin, tee_image.bin |  Yes  |    Yes   |      Yes        |

Note:
(1) "boot_image.bin" contains GSL and U-Boot codes.
(2) "tee_image.bin" contains ATF and OP-TEE codes.
(3) In secure mode, the GSL and U-Boot codes in boot_image.bin can be configured as non-encrypted.

### 1.4 Subsequent Contents
- Section 2 shows how to generate configuration files, built target images and double sign.
- Section 3 discribes the way to burn images;
- Section 4 shows directory structure and introducts functions of directories and files.


## II. Build Images

### 2.1 OEM Build Single-Signed Images

(1) Invoke the script to generate the configuration template "oem/oem_config.json".
```bash
$ python oem/oem_main.py gencfg oem/oem_config.json
```

(2) Referring to "SS626V100 Secure Boot Script Configuration Description", replace the contents enclosed by "/*" and "*/" in "oem/oem_config.json".

(3) Invoke the script to build target images.
```bash
$ python oem/oem_main.py build oem/oem_config.json
```

Target images are output to "image/oem/". If dual signatures are required, please provide the target images for third party.

(4) To clear the output files, run the following command.
```bash
$ python oem/oem_main.py clean
```

### 2.2 Third party Double Sign

(1) Invoke the script to generate the configuration template "third_party_owner/third_party_config.json".
```bash
$ python third_party/third_party_main.py gencfg third_party_config.json
```

(2) Referring to "SS626V100 Secure Boot Script Configuration Description", replace the contents enclosed by "/*" and "*/" in "third_party_owner/third_party_config.json".

(3) Put images built by OEM in the "image/oem/" directory, including:
- boot_image.bin
- tee_image.bin (required only when using TEE Start Flow)

(4) Invoke the script to sign images built by OEM.
```bash
$ python third_party/third_party_main.py build third_party/third_party_config.json
```

Dual-signed target images are ouput to "image/third_party/".

(5) To clear the output files, run the following command.
```bash
$ python third_party/third_party_main.py clean
```

## 3. Image Burning Description

(1) In the non-TEE boot scenario, burn the following content:

|   Image to Burn   |    Components     |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| boot_image.bin    | GSL and U-Boot    |
| uImage_ss626v100  | ATF and  Linux    |
| RootFS Image      | Root File System  |


(2) In the TEE startup scenario, burn the following images:

|   Image to Burn   |    Components     |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| boot_image.bin    | GSL, U-Boot       |
| uImage            | Linux             |
| RootFS Image      | Root File System  |
| tee_image.bin     | ATF, OP-TEE       |


## 4. Directory Structure

The subdirectories of the top-level directory are as follows:
- common/
